\Section{Future extensions}
With time programming languages usually evolve, and the FBDL is no exception, therefore it is quite sensible to employ an architecture that is capable of adaptation to changes in code and also leaves room for extensions. Various elements in the language such as strings, numbers, terminals and keywords are susceptible to change. Regarding the first in the list, strings might contain escape characters and as such the program must strore a list of characters that are accepted as valid escape sequences.
